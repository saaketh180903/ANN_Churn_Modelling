# ANN_Churn_Modelling
Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
Overview
This project involves building and deploying a churn prediction model for a bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model predicts whether a customer will leave the bank or not based on various features like customer demographics, account information, and transaction history.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to help the bank proactively identify customers at risk of churning and take necessary actions to retain them.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for modeling, including encoding categorical variables and scaling features.
Feature Engineering: Techniques used to create relevant features from raw data.
Model Training: Training an ANN model to predict customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics.

The dataset used in this project contains information on bank customers. The key columns in the dataset are as follows:

RowNumber: Unique row identifier
CustomerId: Unique customer identifier
Surname: Customer's surname
CreditScore: Credit score of the customer
Geography: Country of the customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
Balance: Account balance of the customer
NumOfProducts: Number of products the customer has with the bank
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer
Exited: Whether the customer left the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
